# Ceasar_Cypher

Little Rot base cypher for fun.

This is a little program I did as an excercise to find element in an array.

I use Cin to get the user input, as such there is some limitations: 

1- You can't use a space in you input. I know how to resolve the issue and it might get updated soon.

2- You can input any caracters but, only letters will have the desired effect. If I change the input stream it will give more freedom.

That's it!
